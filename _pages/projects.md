## Soft Wearable Robotic Device Based on Smart Home Ecosystem

• Leveraged Deep Learning techniques to detect environmental features, especially stairs, using data obtained from IMU and camera inputs.

• Adapted control policies based on environmental conditions to enhance safety and performance.

• Designed and developed a mobile application with various features, such as:

&emsp;• Speech recognition mode for patient command safety control.

&emsp;• Patient-centered monitoring: knee angle and torque.

&emsp;• Dangerous environment detection alarm.

&emsp;• Emergence call for help.

## UAV Control Based on Reinforcement Learning

Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, ROS, Path Planning

• Setup different environments in ROS for diversified simulation.

• Wrote functions for environment and control to get real-time data and states, calculate rewards and publish command in ROS.

• Design the agent and rewards funtion, and implemented DDPG algorithms for goal searching path planning to control the UAV in unknown environments.

## Video Stabilization
Keywords: Computer Vision

•	Combined the optical flow method with pyramidal Lucas Kanade method to calculate the original camera path from sequential frames, which improved accuracy and efficiency of tracking. 

•	Introduced saliency constraints, considered dynamic model, and replaced the camera path with a feature path, resulting in a more efficient and stable video.
