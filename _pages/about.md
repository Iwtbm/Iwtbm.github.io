Hi there. I'm Wenda(Wendell) Xu.

I'm a Ph.D. candidate majoring in mechanical engineering (Robotics) at Virginia Tech [Robotics and Mechatronics Lab](http://www.rmlab.org/), advised by Prof. Ben-Tzvi. My current research is about the exoskeleton glove system for patients with brachial plexus injuries.

As a passionate robotics enthusiast, I have immersed myself in various fields. My research interests are primarily focused on human-robot interaction, encompassing novel mechanism developments, system integration, dynamic modeling, and intelligent control with various algorithms. My ultimate goal is to create a human-like robot that can contribute to improving our lives.

Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I worked as a System Engineer at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en). Before that, I obtained my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University advised by [Prof. Ciocarlie](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/matei-ciocarlie) and [Prof. Agrawal](https://www.me.columbia.edu/faculty/sunil-agrawal). I obtained B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from Hunan University.

It is a long road to implement AI and letÂ robots take care of us in our dailyÂ life. I would likeÂ to be an acceleratorÂ for the wheel of history.
